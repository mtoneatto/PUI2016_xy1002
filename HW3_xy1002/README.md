# Homework 3

We have a study group for this homework, and we divided for small groups which have different null hypothesis.

Group member: Christian Rosado, Cor215; Jonathan Toy, jt2276; Tyler Woebkenberg, tw1547.
## Asignment 1
I used the skeleton & instruction notebook wrote by professor to develop this part, and I plot all the distribution together,
so the notebook might be slow.

## Asignment 2
I worked with my group member, we discussed the null hypothesis together, and wrote the code seperately. When I encoutered difficulties 
my group member gave me really helpful advices. Also I worte the some part of assignment based on professor's example.

## Asignment 3
I worte this part by myself, I developed a function to test if we can reject the null hypothesis.
