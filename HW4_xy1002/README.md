# Assignment 1 & 2

I worked alone for these two assignments, and for Assignment 1, my paired up classmate is Gladson Laura Ann, net id: lag552, GitHub username: lgladson.

# Assignment 3

We worked as a group, discussed together and developed our code in the skeleton professor gave us. Our group member: Shay Lehman(sl5335), Jonathan Toy(jt2276), Tyler woebkenberg(tw1547). I also changed some part of my code base on my own understanding.

# Assignment 4

I basically worked on my own by developing my code in the skeleton, Shay Lehman(sl5335) gave me a lot of helpful advices to finish it. Since I appended two months dataset in the summer 2015, it took forever to run. Especially for the datetime part, if anyone will run my code, be awear of that it might took so long that I doubt that if it is working. 

# Extra credit

I worked on this by my own used different dataset from those for assignment 4 earlier, because it took too long due to the large data size.
