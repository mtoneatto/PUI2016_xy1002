# Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.**

NULL HYPOTHESIS: People who diet will lose less or the same amount of fat compare to exercise.

_H0: Mean Weight of Test Sample - Mean Weight of Control Sample <= 0_

**Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.**

NULL HYPOTHESIS: The probability of the American saying "yes, they turst the president" is greater or equal to he probability of them saying no.

_H0: P_yes - P_no >= 0_

**Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.**

NULL HYPOTHESIS: the cessation rate for smokers who used nicotine patch is less or equal to the placebo group.

_H0: Cessation rate(nicotine patch) - Cessation rate(placebo patch) <=0_

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.**

NULL HYPOTHESIS: When the mother smoke during the pregnant, her children's IQ at ages 1, 2, 3 and 4 is higher or equal than those childern at the same age whoes mother doesn't. 

_H0: Mean IQ(smoke) - Mean IQ (non smoke) >= 0_
